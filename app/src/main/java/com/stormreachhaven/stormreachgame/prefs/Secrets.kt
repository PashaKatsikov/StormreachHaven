/**
 * Decodes the strings the build encoded into BuildConfig. Never called with a
 * hard-coded array — every input comes from BuildConfig, so the class has no
 * knowledge of what it decodes and no ability to reveal anything on its own.
 *
 * Three interchangeable variants live here. Which one the runtime uses for a
 * particular build is chosen by [BuildConfig.CIPHER_VARIANT], which the build
 * script sets from `gray.codecVariant` in gray.properties. rebrand.py rotates
 * that value across projects, so two apps never share both the algorithm and
 * the parameters — see .cursor/rules/kotlin_fingerprint.mdc.
 *
 * The class name and file path themselves are meant to be renamed per project;
 * rebrand.py does that automatically.
